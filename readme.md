# edLayouts

The utility to examine layouts for ErgoDox keyboard.

## Why?

There are plenty tools already that estimate layouts.
But they all have the one fatal flaw: they based on standard keyboards.

In addition, authors of those layouts assume that you use fingers strictly vertically.
But in my case it does not work.
For exapmple, it's much more comfortable for me to use ring finger for P and Q instesad of pinky.
I don't know who is mutant in this case.

ErgoDox keyboard very different and it's much bigger than a regular laptop keyboard.
On a normal keyboard you don't have to tilt your wrist when you press N or B buttons.

Another reason, I wanted to try F# for some small project and scope of this assigment is perfect for F#.
