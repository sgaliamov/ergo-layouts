# edLayouts

The utility to examine layouts for ErgoDox keyboard.

## Why?

ErgoDox is such a keyboard for which you first need to learn a functional programming language with static typing, and then create a utility to find the most optimal configuration for you.
Joke.
A functional language with dynamic typing is also suitable.

All jokes aside.
There are plenty tools already that estimate layouts.
But they all have the one fatal flaw: they based on standard keyboards.

In addition, authors of those layouts assume that you use fingers strictly vertically.
But in my case it does not work.
For exapmple, it's much more comfortable for me to use ring finger for P and Q instesad of pinky.
I don't know who is mutant in this case.

ErgoDox keyboard very different, and it's much bigger than a regular laptop keyboard.
On a regular keyboard for example, you don't have to tilt your wrist when you press N buttons because all buttons are shifted.
But on ErgoDox all buttons are strictly vertical.
And it's much easier to use pinky fingers on top row.
On my laptop I can reach P and Q without any afforts using pinky, but on ErgoDox it's very uncomfortable.
Maybe it's "bad habits" or adaptation period, but I just don't see how should I place my hands to enable pinky 100%.

Another reason, I wanted to try F# for some small project and scope of this assigment is perfect for F#.
