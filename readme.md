Is a utility to examine layouts for ErgoDox keyboard.

## Why?

ErgoDox is such a keyboard for which you first need to learn a functional programming language with static typing, and then create a utility to find the most optimal configuration for it.
Joke.
A functional language with dynamic typing is also suitable.

There are plenty tools already that estimate layouts.
But they all have the one fatal flaw: they based on standard keyboards.

ErgoDox keyboard is very different, and it's bigger than a regular laptop keyboard.
On a regular keyboard for example, you don't have to tilt your wrist when you press button N because all buttons are shifted.
On ErgoDox all buttons are strictly vertical.
On the other hand, in the literal and figurative sense, button B is more reachable now.

It's much easier to use pinky fingers on top row on a regular keyboard.
On my laptop I can reach P and Q without any efforts using pinkies, but on ErgoDox it's not really comfortable.
Maybe it's because of "bad habits" or adaptation period, but I just don't see how should I place my hands to enable pinkies 100%, even if I want.

Another reason, I wanted to try F# for some small project and scope of this assignment is perfect for F#.
I feel I returned 10 years back - learning how to type, learning how to program again. Very interesting experience.

## Summary

Do I recommend to buy the ErgoDox keyboard? Er... not sure. This keyboard is definitely not for everyone.
If you are not a keyboard geek, or you are not ready for a radical new experience, then more traditional ergonomic keyboard is much wiser option.

There is another trap that you can get into. If you are perfectionist, like me, you risk to spend a lot of time trying


In addition, authors of those layouts assume that you use fingers strictly vertically.
But in my case it does not work.
For example, it's much more comfortable for me to use ring finger for P and Q instead of pinky.
I don't know who is mutant in this case.
