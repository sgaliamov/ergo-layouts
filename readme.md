# edLayouts

Is a utility to examine layouts for ErgoDox keyboard.

## Why?

ErgoDox is such a keyboard for which you first need to learn a functional programming language with static typing, and then create a utility to find the most optimal configuration for you.
Joke.
A functional language with dynamic typing is also suitable.

All jokes aside.
There are plenty tools already that estimate layouts.
But they all have the one fatal flaw: they based on standard keyboards.

In addition, authors of those layouts assume that you use fingers strictly vertically.
But in my case it does not work.
For exapmple, it's much more comfortable for me to use ring finger for P and Q instesad of pinky.
I don't know who is mutant in this case.

ErgoDox keyboard is very different, and it's bigger than a regular laptop keyboard.
On a regular keyboard for example, you don't have to tilt your wrist when you press button N because all buttons are shifted.
On ErgoDox all buttons are strictly vertical.
On the other hand, in the literal and figurative sense, button B is more reachable now.

It's much easier to use pinky fingers on top row on a regular keyboard.
On my laptop I can reach P and Q without any afforts using pinkies, but on ErgoDox it's not really comfortable.
Maybe it's because of "bad habits" or adaptation period, but I just don't see how should I place my hands to enable pinkies 100%, even if I want.

Another reason, I wanted to try F# for some small project and scope of this assigment is perfect for F#.
I feel I returned 10 years back - learing how to type, learing how to programm again. Very interesting experience.
