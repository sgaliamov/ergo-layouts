# edLayouts

The utility to extimate layouts for ErgoDox keyboard.

## Why?

There are plenty tools already that estimate layouts. But they all have the fatal flaw: they based on standard keyboards.

In addition, authors of those layouts assume that you use fingers strictly vertically. But in my case it's not true. For exapmple, it's much more comfortable for me to use ring finger for P and Q instesad of pinky. I don't know who is mutant in this case.

Another reason, I wanted to try F# for some small project and scope of this assigment is perfect for F#.
