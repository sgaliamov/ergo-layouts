# Reasoning

## To configure

1. 26 letters
1. 11 standard symbolic buttons
1. shifted symbols:

    1. "
    1. (
    1. )
    1. {
    1. }

total to configure:  42.

No need to care about `shift`, `space`, `enter` and others because they will be placed on extra keys anyway.

## Scoring

1. Efforts based on configuration. Should go down.
1. Same fingers. Should go down.
1. Сharacters printed with one hand without changing.. Should go up.
1. Hands balance. Left and right hands should be used equally.
1. Inward rolls are more preferable than outward.
1. Fingers statistic.
