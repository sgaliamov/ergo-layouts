orchestrators when you design your domain model based on aggregates moving to nosql and documentoriented databases might be even easier than using a relational database because the aggregates as you

is possible to create events entries for etw by using the eventsource class in the net framework directly but it s not a simple task instead consider using a logging framework that provides a simple
